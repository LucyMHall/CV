I'm a full stack developer with experience writing test-driven code in Ruby and Javascript.

I'm looking for a role which allows me to improve people's day to day experiences, be it my colleagues or the general public. I have a high level of determination when faced with a challenge, and I am always interested in learning new things - I am currently looking into coding and accessibility.

Prior to applying to Makers, I received a 2.1 degree in History from the University of Cambridge and went on to spend one and a half years in Arts Marketing, working extensively with visiting artists and their teams to create bespoke marketing campaigns.

## **Skills**

#### **Teamwork**

- I am a cheerful person who enjoys collaborating with others and ensuring they feel valued. I regularly ask for feedback to enable me to keep improving my group communication skills, both face-to-face and through a google form I created. I also championed the creation of team member 'user manuals' during my final project to help establish a comfortable team dynamic from the outset. 

#### **Communication**
- I am a strong written and verbal communicator. I created engaging, clear and informative content for a variety of different audiences as a marketing assistant for the Albany, and after finishing Makers I started [a blog](https://medium.com/@lucymhall1995) to document my continuing learning.

#### **Problem Solving**
- During my time at Makers I honed my ability to logically break down a daunting task, such as create and test a web app using completely new technology in 4-5 days, into manageable pieces. Multiple peers I have paired with have commented on my *'calm methodical approach to debugging'*\*, I have an optimistic outlook and encourage myself to celebrate small wins, an attitude necessary when debugging complicated code.

#### **Fast Learner**
- I have always enjoyed taking on new challenges. When I first started as a marketing assistant I learnt the basics of Adobe Photoshop, InDesign, Campaign Monitor, Wordpress and Twitter in just two weeks, through careful note taking and practice.  I was also initially offered the job after volunteering in the department for just a week, due to my ability and eagerness to learn new things.

#### **Organisation**
- Prior to makers I developed strong organisational skills and resilience under pressure through balancing my time between my regular work, creating and managing multiple marketing campaigns, and responding to ad hoc tasks.
