## **Skills**

#### **Teamwork**

- I am a cheerful person who enjoys collaborating with others and ensuring they feel valued. I regularly ask for feedback to enable me to keep improving my group communication skills, both face-to-face and through a google form I created. I also championed the creation of team member 'user manuals' during my final project to help establish a comfortable team dynamic from the outset.

#### **Communication**
- I am a strong written and verbal communicator. I created engaging, clear and informative content for a variety of different audiences as a marketing assistant for the Albany, and after finishing Makers I started [a blog](https://medium.com/@lucymhall1995) to document my continuing learning.

#### **Problem Solving**
- As a marketing assistant and lead for the Albany's Family Marketing Strategy I had to frequently monitor progress, evaluate what was and was not working and make adjustments within a limited time frame

#### **Fast Learner**
- I have always enjoyed taking on new challenges. When I first started as a marketing assistant I learnt the basics of Adobe Photoshop, InDesign, Campaign Monitor, Wordpress and Twitter in just two weeks, through careful note taking and practice.  I was also initially offered the job after volunteering in the department for just a week, due to my ability and eagerness to learn new things

#### **Organisation**
- Prior to makers I developed strong organisational skills and resilience under pressure through balancing my time between my regular work, creating and managing multiple marketing campaigns, and responding to ad hoc tasks.
